# tic-tac-toe

Tic Tac Toe Game. The main goal was to use modules and factory functions/objects as a way of practice. So although it could have less code, and be done differently, It would defeat the purpose. AI was implemented afterwards, using a minimax algorithm. Added a tweak to it, so it could be defeated.

This was done with desktop in mind, but adapted to be viewed and used in cellphones as well.
